Animations performed on the circular structure known as the "Flower of life"

# The Story 
I was sitting in my house when my weed loving buddy spoke up about the flower of life. So naturally I told him... Yes I will write a program to understand such a pattern and ultimately the universe. 

Now he watches it twice a day to keep the bad highs away.

# Notes 
## Performance
There are a lot of varying components when it comes too visualizing music. Most of the the current complexity goes into the detail of the graphics. 

I recommend using _Mozzila_ as their just in time compiler and opengl optimizations are far supperior to that of Googles or Apple's products. 

*What if my computer is a piece of junk or I am too cool to use mozzila?*

You can turn the complexity of the program by ajusting the sections used to illstrate the frequencies. This will in turn not display a very detailed visual analysis.
